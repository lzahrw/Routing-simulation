Network Layer Practical Exercise: Distance Vector Routing Simulation
This project simulates real-time routing using the Distance Vector Routing algorithm. The program processes input commands such as adding/removing links, updating distance vectors, routing new packets, and printing the router's current distance vector. The simulation assumes no overlapping subnets in the input.

Key features include:

Adding/removing links between routers
Handling distance vector updates from neighbors
Routing packets based on the current distance vector
Real-time simulation of router behavior
The project demonstrates the fundamentals of network layer routing in a controlled environment.
